# Design-and-Deployment-of-an-AI-Powered-Predictive-System
Develop and deploy machine learning or AI-based model for a real-world application. Preprocess data, build and evaluate a predictive model, and deploy the solution using Flask so that it can be accessed via a simple web interface.
-----------------------------------------------
Project Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

• Explore and analyze a real-world dataset (Heart Disease UCI).

• Build and evaluate a supervised ML or AI model.

• Develop a user-facing web interface with Flask.

• Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
